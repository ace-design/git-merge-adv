# Algorithm Demos

## Rationale

In order to better understand to strengths and limitations of our algorithms, it is necessary for us to perform tests as "demos". 
* As such, the purpose of this folder is to provide a visual and quantitative representation of our current work. 

## Prerequisites

Execute run_algo.py:

`python3 run_algo.py --cs <path to case study folder> --algo <name of desired algorithm> --lang <language used in case study>`

## Acknowledgements

* All quantitative measurements, and visuals obtained from [https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree]
