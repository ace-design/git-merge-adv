# Algorithm Demos:

## Rationale:

In order to better understand to strengths and limitations of our algorithms, it is necessary for us to perform tests as "demos".
* All case studies are extracted from a curated list of well-known projects obtained from the Awesome Python and Java lists.

## Results:

### Java Results:

![Java Comparison](java_case_studies/images/Comparison.png)

Tool | Deletions | Insertions | Moves | Diff Paths | Num Conflicts | Num Errors | Overall |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
CompressedTree | 484 | 864 | 517 | 129 | 134 | 0 | 1132.54 |
MethodUnion | 612 | 1312 | 659 | 103 | 67 | 0 | 1595.39 |
Spork | 1027 | 2208 | 1546 | 179 | 96 | 0 | 2891.60 |
jDime | 1133 | 1163 | 790 | 330 | 119 | 0 | 1839.41 |

Overall empirical results suggest that CompressedTree & MethodUnion are more semantically equivalent to the desired version than other tools. 
Results show that: 
* Tools are removing less necessary code
* Merged result will include less unused code
* Original code structure is being preserved better
*  Tools choose correct changes more often

### Python Results:

![Python Comparison](python_case_studies/images/Comparison.png)

Tool | Deletions | Insertions | Moves | Diff Paths | Num Conflicts | Num Errors | Overall |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
CompressedTree | 383 | 350 | 301 | 170 | 100 | 0 | 631.42 |
MethodUnion | 714 | 602 | 452 | 504 | 93 | 1 | 1158.05 |

CompressedTree and MethodUnion also demonstrate strong accuracy for Python
* Results for Java were from a total of 86 case studies,
whereas Python a total of 91 case studies
* Given this, the ratio of Overall results to case studies
is better for Python

The overall difference between CompressedTree and MethodUnion is small in Java meaning our heuristics provide approximately the same accuracy as Git Merge on the body with half the conflicts.

Logically the difference in Python makes sense since we have yet to add comments and maintain the code structure for it. 

## Comparison Methodlogy:
 To analyze the accuracy of each tool, we measured the difference between the developer's desired version and results generated by each tool using Gumtree. 

 ### Measurements for Comparison:
 * Deletions: Code that is present in desired version but not in the result.
 * Insertions: Code that is present in the result, but not the desired version.
 * Moves: Same code, but on different lines
 * Diff Paths: Same structure, but slightly different code segments.
 * Conflicts: Conflicts present after the merge is complete.
 * Errors: Gumtree cannot execute because of syntax errors in the generated results.

The overall accuracy is measured as the vector distance from the desired version using all measurements.

### Assumptions:
1. All input files are of correct syntax. Any case study with incorrect input files will be eliminated from results.
2. Developers will choose the correct conflict resolution when having to manually resolve some merge conflicts.
    * To account for this in our comparison, we cross reference each merge conflict in generated file to the desired version to see what the developer wants. As such, it will be <i>ignored<i> by gumtree.


## Prerequisites:

### &nbsp; Script Commands:

> run_algo.py:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose:
* To run specified case studies using desired tool. Can run one, or multiple case studies. 
* Outputs result of each case study to [Python demo_result](python_case_studies/demo_results/) or Java [Java demo_result](java_case_studies/demo_results/) folder under specified tool. 
* All quantitative results will be added to the associated .csv files for each tool under demo_result.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Execution: 
```
python3 <path to run_algo.py>/run_algo.py --cs <path to case study folder> --algo <name of desired algorithm> --lang <language used in case study> --purpose <all or spec>
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flags:
* cs: Enter the path to desired case study. Can be parent directory (purpose is to run all), or specific case study directory (purpose is to run spec)
* algo: Enter the name of desired Tool (MethodUnion, CompressedTree, etc...)
* lang: Enter the language for the case study
* purpose: Specify whether you want to run multiple case studies (all) or just one (spec)



> run_analysis.py:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose:
* To output a graph/visual comparison between all tools that were run. 
* Graph will be outputted to [Python Images](python_case_studies/images/Comparison.png) or [Java Images](java_case_studies/images/Comparison.png) depending on the language.
* Script will also output all numerical data in terminal.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Execution:
```
python3 run_analysis.py --dir <path to case study>
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flags:
* dir: Enter the path to the directory 

### &nbsp; Gumtree Commands:

> Python Execution:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Import Differencing:

```
java -jar gumtree.jar -m theta webdiff <Path to Desired Version> <Path to Generated Version>
```
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Body Differencing:

```
java -jar gumtree.jar -m gumtree-simple-id webdiff <Path to Desired Version> <Path to Generated Version>
```

* Important Note: When trying to use Gumtree for python files, make sure you add the pythonparser to your local computer path from [https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/pythonparser]

    1. Clone the repository
    2. cd pythonparser/
    3. pip install -r requirements.txt
    4. cp pythonparser /tmp
    5. PATH=$PATH:/tmp

> Java Execution:

```
java -jar gumtree.jar -m gumtree-simple-id -g java-jdt webdiff <Path to Desired Version> <Path to Generated Version>
```
