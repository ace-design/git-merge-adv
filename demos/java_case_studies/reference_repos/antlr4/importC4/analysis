Observations:
- Left and Right version have two different set of imports with the exception of `.NotNull`.
- Every import that base has, the left and right version also have (all 2)

Analysis:
- If the ordering of `.NotNull` wasn't changed between left and right version, there would be no merge conflict. Order switch causes the merge conflict.
