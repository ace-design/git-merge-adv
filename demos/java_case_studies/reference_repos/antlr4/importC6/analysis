Observations:
- Left and Right version have a different set of imports included. 
- Right version has added imports on top of ones that are in the base version. 
- Right and Base version are similar in the `.atn.*` package. Left version doesn't have this.

Analysis:
- Makes sense why git causes a conflict, since all 3 versions are different, and the added imports in right and left version occur in the middle. Which messes up the ordering.
