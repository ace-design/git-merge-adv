Analysis:

- This is a classic case of refractoring the code , the import statements were completely refractored in left while they were same in right and base , git causes conflict , while spork and Jdime does work on refractoring but they miss out some imports that are present in desired file

like

import org.codehaus.plexus.component.annotations.Requirement;
