Observations:
- One line of imports from mypy.nodes is different across all file versions.

Analysis:
- Logically makes sense why git causes this conflict, since git merges based on textual basis. 
  - Structural tree diagrams, like the one we created for merge-algorithms would prevent this issue from occuring.
