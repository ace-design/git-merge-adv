Observations:
- Base and left versions have different mypy.myunit imports. Left version imports one less thing than the base version.
- Base and right versions import same mypy.myunit methods. However right version also imports an additional `defaults` method from mypy. 

Analysis:
- Although Base and Right version have the same method imports from mypy.myunit, Git doesn't go with the left version for that line. 
- Also, the right version is the only one that imports `defaults`  from mypy, but git still causes conflict with that line.
