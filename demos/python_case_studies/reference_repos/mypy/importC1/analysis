Observations:
- Left version had one additional import from typing from base.
- Right version has two less import from typing from base.

Analysis:
- All 3 versions have 2 common imports from typing. Base and left version have an additional 2 that are common. Logically Git would choose the right version because of this for those two. 
- Because all imports from typing occur on the same line in Python, Git recognizes all 3 imports from typing to be different. So it causes conflict.
