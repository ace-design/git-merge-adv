#  This is the config-template for Err. This file should be copied and   #

#  you like it.                                                          #

#  As this is a regular Python file, note that you can do variable       #

#  Note: Various config options require a tuple to be specified, even    #

#  the BOT_ADMINS option. Make sure you use a valid tuple here, even if  #
#  you are only configuring a single item, else you will get errors.     #
