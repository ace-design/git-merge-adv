Left Parent Hash:2dbf296f
Right Parent Hash:8ebe8b55
Base Hash: cf62edeb
File Name: tests/test_maths.py

Observations:
- Left version and right version have one additional import that are different. Base version doesn't have either of these addtional import.

Analysis:
- Evidently all three versions are different, so there is a merge conflict when git runs its 3-way algorithm.
