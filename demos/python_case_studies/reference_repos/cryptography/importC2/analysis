Observations:
- methods imported from `.utils` is different across all versions. 
- methods imported from `...utils` are the same, however different ordering. All methods are imported on one line. 

Analysis:
- It makes sense why methods imported from `.utils ` cause conflicts. Since all 3 versions are different.
- Git algorithm recognizes that all methods imported from `...utils` are the same, just different order. 
  - Usually Git's algorithm doesn't do this since it is text based, but it does this time. Reason is unknown.
