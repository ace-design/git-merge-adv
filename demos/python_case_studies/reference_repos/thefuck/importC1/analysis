File Name: thefuck/corrector.py

Observations:
- Base and right version have one line that is common between them and not left version. `from . import conf, types, logs`.
  - Base version also has an additional `eager` package that is imported that is present in the left version, but not right. 
- Left version also has 2 new pacakges imported from `thefuck.types` on a new line. 
- Git also causes conflict with import sys which is present in all 3. This error may be the result of the inconsistent ordering. 
- Ordering for the import stakements are not consistent between all 3. 

Analysis:
- Since Base and Right are common for conf, types and logs I would expect git to choose the left version for that. 
  - Assumption: Since ordering is not consistent, git identifies a conflict for that line. 
- I would also assume git would choose to add the packages from `thefuck` to the merged files. However it still causes conflict.
  - Assumption: Possibly the inconsistent ordering is what caused this conflict.
