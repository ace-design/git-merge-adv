# Python Demos

## Results

* Note: Formatting still needs to be fixed. Gumtree is inaccurate because of formattting, so results need to be updated after it is fixed. 

### CompressedTree Algorithm:

* 4 Deletions: Every package in desired version is present in the result.
* 11 insertions: Extra packages present in the result that are not there in the desired.
* 27 Moves: Number of import statements in the result that are in a different spot from desired.
* 3 Different Paths: Number of import statements in result that are from the wrong path.
