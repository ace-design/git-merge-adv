Analysis:
- Merge conflict with added 'java.util.Set' package, and keeping existing package.
- User wanted to keep both packages.
- JDime seems to discard the imported Set package since it isn't used anywhere in code.
    - By analysis of code, this makes sense and JDime is correct. But not what user wanted.
- Spork causes a conflict forcing user to choose between the two. Doesn't want to keep both.
    - Analysis of code shows Pattern is used. So it would be wrong to delete it. Spork handles this wrong.
