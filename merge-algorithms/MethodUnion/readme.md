# MethodUnion

* Works off CompressedTree, additional features.
* Unions the methods and classes in code. Merges import the same way as CompressedTree.



### Future Development:
* Add field declartion for classes.

### Execution:

* Run Compressed Import Tree:

    `python3 init.py --left <left parent path> --right <right parent path> --base <base file path> --out <output file> --file <name of file>`
