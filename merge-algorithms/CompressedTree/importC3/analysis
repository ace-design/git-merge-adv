Commit Hash: edc0285d7
Left Parent Hash: 9328797c
Right Parent Hash: 2d7bdc87
Base Hash: ed32d9a4
File Name: mypy/checker.py

Observations:
- Right version has additional ComplexExpr package on same line.
  - Git will recognize these two lines to be different.
- Left version has one line of import that is different from the base, and one additional line of import.
  - The left version line that is different, is also different from the right version.

Analysis:
- Based on past case studies, this is expected from git.
  - Since git is more textual based, it is logical for there to be conflict when all three files have a different line.
