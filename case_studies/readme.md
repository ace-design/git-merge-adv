# Merge Case Studies

## Rationale

Analysis of case studies from credible, and well-developed projects help us obtain quality results that we can use to further support our project development.

## Pre-requisites:

*  `base.java`: Common ancestor between left and right parents.
*  `left.java`: Left parent of merge
* `right.java`: Right parent of merge
* `desired.java`: Version of file after user manually handled.
*  `git.java`: Version of file after git algorithm tried to handle.
* `spork_result.java`: Version of file after spork tried to handle.
