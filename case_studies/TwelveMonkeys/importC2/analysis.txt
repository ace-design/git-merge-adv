Analysis:
- There were changes in left and right version of import statements , git , jdime and spork algorithms gave out the same resolution to the difference during the merges
, in my opinion surprising thing is that git should have given conflicts in the merge statements but it didn't it automatically merged

- Jdime do changes the formatting , like it coupled all the inport statements
- Important takeaway is that none of them matched the desired result which was diffrent 
-  The final desired resoluton contained 

"
import javax.swing.*;
import com.twelvemonkeys.image.BufferedImageIcon;
"

These both statements were somehow part of the right version but were not included in merge done by Jdime/git/spork
