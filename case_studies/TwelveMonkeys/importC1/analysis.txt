Analysis:
- The base and left version used the java.util.* to get all the import from utils but the right
version individually called  
"
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List; "
- there were changes in formatting too in the right version
this caused conflict , the git accepted the right version and the conflict is caused due to changed formatting.
 
- In the desired.java the developer maintains the original base formatting and usees .util.*  instead of adding individual imports
