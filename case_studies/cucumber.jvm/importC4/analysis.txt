Analysis:
- Very big structure change. Program goes from mainly using packages from `runtime` and `runner` to `core`.
    - Desired action is to switch everything to core, as shown in the left parent. 
- Of course, git's algorithm doesn't recognize which version to use, and causes merge conflict.
- Interestingly, spork and jdime recognize which version to use, and choose left parent changes.
    - Since Spork and JDime are Java based, its possible the algorithm checks which one compiles. 
    - Highly unlikely that both packages offer the same services, so compilation error may let algorithm know which to choose.
- Uncertain how we would select without a compilation.
