Observations:
- Base and left version differ in the `ShoppingSteps...` imports. 
- Base and right version differ in the ordering of the first two imports. They are in switched position.

- Right version removes wildcard, and only imports packages that are used. 
- Left version refactors the directories. Most packages now have a different path.

Analysis:
- User wanted the version that does not contain anything from `ShoppingSteps` directory.
- When git runs its merge algorithm, it compares the base to the left, and base to the right. Since all three versions are different, it creates a merge conflict.
- Interestingly, when it runs its merge algorithm LCM doesn't group the first two lines of left.java and base.java. Instead, it groups all 3 lines weirdly. 
    - Assumption: If the ordering of the import in base was changed to match the base, there wouldn't be as much conflict.
    - Validation Test: Less conflicts. The only conflict now is whether to include `ShoppingSteps.Price` or not. 
- Both JDime and Spork correctly infer this result, and do what user desired.
