# Git Mining Scripts


## Merge_Conflicts
* Returns a csv file with list of commits that had a merge conflict.

    `python3 init.py --filename <merge-conflicts.csv> --line <line-number in CSV> --repo <name of Clone repo> --lang <Programming Language>`

## Conflict_Resolving
* Outputs the list of files associated with a specific merge conflict hash. List of fies includes left, right, base, desired and git.
* References the csv file generated by the merge_conflict script.

    `python3 init.pyt --url <Clone URL> --output <Output file name>`

## Conflict_Finder
* Given a cloning url, this script outputs all conflicts with all associated files to the demos folder under the repo name. Usees the Merge_Conflicts and Conflict_Resolving scripts to do so.

    `python3 init.py --repo <Git Clone URL> --lang <Desired Language for extraction>`

## Java_Conflicts
* References spork's case studies in data.csv to extract java case studies. Similar script to conflict_finder, but specific only to case studies that spork used.
* Can be extended to other languages too. 

    `python3 init.py --reference <Path to Reference CSV> --lang <Desired Language (usually Java)> `
