Observations:
- Base version uses wildcard for packages from the `runner` directory. 
- Right version removes wildcard, and only imports packages that are used. 
- Left version refactors the directories. Most packages now have a different path.

Analysis:
- Git's merge conflict stems from the fact that left, right and base version all have different paths and package name. 
    - Because the base version uses a wildcard, and the right one actually imports the package name, it creates conflict since git being text based doesn't recognize it as the same. 
- Spork handles the merge incorrectly since it incorrectly uses the non-refactored paths for some packages, and refactored paths for other packages. This would cause a code compilation error. 
- JDime handles the merge incorrectly as it uses refactored and non-refactored paths one after the other. Will cause compilation error.
