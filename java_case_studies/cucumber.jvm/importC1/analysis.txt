Analysis:
- Git's merge conflict with OutputStream in left parent. OutputStream doesn't exist in right parent or base parent, and does in LeftParent.
- Removing OutputStream doesn't cause conflict despite right parent removing StringWriter and PrintWriter. Git's algorithm just accepts Right parent changes.
- Initial Assumption: Git causes merge conflcit, when different package is added to same line. Doesn't cause conflict, when existing package is removed.
    - Revised Assumption: Git causes merge conflict when any package is added to the same line. Even if package is the same duplicate one.
