Observations:
- Base and Right version import the same things from `thefuck.utils`. 
  - Left version imports an additional thing from that package.
- Right version imports shells which base doesn't. 

Analysis:
- Since right version imports shells on line 2, the base, left and right version have different things on line 2. 
  - Logically makes sense since Git's textual comparison takes into consideration lines as well.
