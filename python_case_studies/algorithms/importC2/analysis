Observations:
- Base and right versions are the exact same for import statements.
- Base and Left have the same content, however the order of imports is changed.

Analysis:
- Git still causes conflict despite the base and right versions being the same. 
    - Assumption: Git's 3-way merge algorithm doesn't only rely on the base, right and left version. It may rely on Git's past history as well.
