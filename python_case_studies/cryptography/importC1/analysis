Observations:
- Left version has an additional import that base and right version don't. This is what causes conflict.
- package changes from `tests.utl` in base to `...utils` in right and left. Git handles this merge.

Analysis:
- Although the package that is imported in the left version is extra, it is added before the common cases. 
  - We know from before that git relies on the ordering of packages at a line-by-line basis. 
- Weirdly however, the name change from `tests.utils` to `...utils` happens after the conflict, and git handles it.
  - This is not consistent with importC2 in the `thefuck` repository.
