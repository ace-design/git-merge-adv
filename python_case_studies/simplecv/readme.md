## Rationale:
* There is a larger sample space for python code than mypy and algorithm repositories. 
* Possibly more import conflicts because of this. 


### Good Import Conflicts:
 Case | Line | Commmit Hash | Git 
--- | --- | --- | ---
C1 | 9 | 3e5b38c | Conflict


### Interesting Cases:
 Case | Line | Commmit Hash | Odd Case
--- | --- | --- | --- |
