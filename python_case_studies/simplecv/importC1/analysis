Observation:
- Import statement at the bottom of code is aprt of the conflict.
- Base version does not have such import statement, but the left and right versions do. 
- Right and left version have different line for the analysis. 

Analysis:
- Logically since the line is different across all 3 versions, there is a merge conflict when git runs its algorithm.
