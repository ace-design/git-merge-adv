File Name: blaze/compute/tests/test_sql_compute.py

Analysis:

- The git causes conflicts , the import statement which was unique in left :

from blaze.compute.sql import (compute, select, lower_column, compute_up,
                               get_all_froms)

is not taken in the desired file based as the develper does his custom thing and does not use the line of codes containing get_all_froms function
