# Python Merge Case Studies

## Rationale

Analysis of case studies from credible, and well-developed projects help us obtain quality results that we can use to further support our project development.

Our secondary focus on Python will provide us with specific syntax that we can use to develop a slightly higher level algorithm than our previous Java one. 

## Pre-requisites:

*  `base.java`: Common ancestor between left and right parents.
*  `left.java`: Left parent of merge
* `right.java`: Right parent of merge
* `desired.java`: Version of file after user manually handled.
*  `git.java`: Version of file after git algorithm tried to handle.
